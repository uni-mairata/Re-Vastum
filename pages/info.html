  <h1>Track Your Recyclables' Impact</h1>
	<p><b>WHAT IS THE ONGOING PROBLEM?</b></p>
  <p>
    Massive amounts of municipal solid waste (MSW) is being generated annually but only a fraction is recycled. In 2018, 292.4 million tons were produced, accounting for 4.9 pounds per person daily. However, only 94 million tons were recycled.</p>
     <p>Landfills are constantly expanding, taking up land space. Approximately 1.3 billion tons of waste goes to landfills each year, and by 2025 it is estimated that waste going to landfills each year will be nearly doubled, to 2.2 billion tons.</p>
     <p> Landfills contribute to greenhouse gas emissions (such as CO2) and groundwater pollution.</p>

    <p><b><blockquote>COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT RECYCLING</blockquote></b></p>
     <ol>
       <li>Materials can only be recycled once - <em style= "color:Tomato;">recyclables can actually be recycled mutliple times</em></li>
       <li>The chasing arrow symbol means that an item is recyclable - <em style= "color:Tomato;">the symbol is misleading because it is on every single plastic container and the number embedded inside of the symbol is used to identify the class of resin in the container. </em></li>
       <li> To-go cups and boxes are not recylable, and will contribute to contaminatioon - <em style= "color:Tomato;"> styrofoam is not recyclable although great amounts of it are recycled on a daily basis.</em></li></p>

     <p><b>FAQ</b></p>
     <p>1. What is recycling?
       <br>
       <blockquote><em>Recycling is the act of collecting certain used items and transforming them into new reusable items, instead of permanently trashing them, which could harm the environment.</em></blockquote>

       <li>Paper</li>
       <li>Food boxes</li>
       <li>Mail</li>
       <li>Beverage cans</li>
       <li>Food cans</li>
       <li>Glass bottles</li>

     </p>
     <p>4. How does recycling benefit the environment?
       <br>
       <blockquote><em>Recycling benefits the environment because it enables conservation of energy. This is because recycling various materials can be manufactured, preventing people from having to extract and use up more natural resources. Therefore, resources are also preserved and wasted less, so forms of nonrenewable energy are being used up slower. Recycling also ensures that less waste becomes incorporated into landfills, which contributes to the piling of solid waste and limiting land use. This means that there would be less pollution to the earth, therefore preserving the flora and fauna and protecting their homes. Moreover, it opens new job opportunities at recycling centers and manufacturing industries - it provides 681 thousand jobs annually. </em></blockquote>
